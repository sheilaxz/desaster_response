# disaster_response  
Analysis of disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.  

The data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. In this project, a machine learning pipeline is created to categorize these events so that the messages can be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency.  

This repository includes files that work on local computer before deployment. Another repository [disaster_response_app](https://github.com/sheilaxz/disaster_response_app) includes files and structures after successful deployment on Heroku. Both two repositories are for the purpose of learning web development.
